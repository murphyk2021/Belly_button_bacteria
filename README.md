### Overview
The human body is home to an impressive number of bacterial species.  In fact, prokaryotic cells outnumber eukaryotic cells by approximately 10 to 1! Luckily, this diversity provides our body with a miriad of benefits ranging from protection against harmful pathogens to the synthesis of essential vitamins!  In this module, our friend Rosa is hoping to isolate bacterial species from the human body in the hopes of identifying and culturing a species which can synthesize proteins that mimic the taste of meat for her company, *Improbable Beef*.  To help her with this goal, we used Javascript and the d3 plotting library to sort, filter, and visualize records of bacterial species isolated from the belly buttons of volunteers from across the country.  We then used Plotly and bootstrap to create dynamic charts and graphs of each of the experimental samples.  She will be able to share this webpage with her colleagues as they continue to work on this project.
